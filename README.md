_Applied Deep L-Layer Neural Network for Image Classification with a set of cat images to distinguished cat and non-cat img.
_Applied Tensorflow and Keras on landsat Satellite data to build a network model with various method for accuracy improvement including 
relu and softmax regression for output more than 2 classes. The improvement methods that I used for this project are :
- Weight initialization methods with random numbers
- Regularization L2
- Mini-batch gradient descent with 64 mini batch
- Gradient descent optimization algorithm with Adam
